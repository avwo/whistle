# Usage of the `@` Symbol  

When you want to store rules on a remote server or in a local project file and have Whistle automatically synchronize and update them, you can use the `@` symbol in the rules.  

## Syntax Rules  

## 1. Importing Rule Files (`@path`)  
Dynamically load the content of external rule files. Whistle will periodically update the content from the rule files.  

**Usage Format:** `@file-path-or-url`  

**Supported Types:**  
- Remote URL: `@https://example.com/rules.txt`  
- Local File: `@~/projects/rules.txt` (supports all operating system paths)  
- Plugin Interface: `@whistle.nohost/api/rules` (requires the plugin to implement the interface)  

> **Windows Path Compatibility:** Supports mixing `/` and `\` as path separators:  
> ```txt  
> @C:/whistle/rules.txt  
> @D:\config\proxy.rules  
> ```  

## Configuration Examples  

### Import Remote Rule Files  
```txt  
@https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/configs/master/whistle-rules.txt  
```  

### Import Local Project Rules  
```txt  
@/Users/username/projects/my-app/whistle-config.txt  
@~/dev/configs/rules.txt  # Using the user directory  
```  

### Import Rules Provided by Plugins  
```txt  
@whistle.nohost/api/rules  
```  

### Mixed Usage Example  
```txt  
# Import team-shared base rules  
@https://team.example.com/configs/base-rules.txt  

# Import personal project-specific rules  
@~/projects/my-app/whistle-overrides.txt  

```  

## File Format Requirements  

Imported external files should contain standard Whistle rule syntax:  

```txt  
# Example of a remote rule file  
www.example.com proxy://127.0.0.1:8080  
api.example.com resCors://*  
static.example.com cache://3600  
```
